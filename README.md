# MetroPolis.com by Function Force

The repository for the HackIET, the Internal Hackathon at the Institute of Engineering and Technology.

The theme chosen by our team is Smart Cities and the Idea, we are developing is MetroPolis.com.
MetroPolis.com is the ultimate guide for anyone to mark the maps, show nearby essential services, and then render the nearest routes, at their convenience.

The complete idea can be accessed here:

The idea is currently in the development phase and requires the mentors' and jury's insight to make it a better Project.
